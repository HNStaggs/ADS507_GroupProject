## Data Scope and Purpose: 
The COVID-19 pandemic has altered many aspects of life around the globe. In this pipeline, data from various sources are combined as a way to explore impacts of COVID on health, education, and the economy (GDP). Over three dozen countries can be compared on various metrics. The data is called from APIs that store historical COVID data, in addition to three static CSV files, one on COVID impacts on education, one on historical GDP and GDP forecast, and one on.... These files are located in the repository.
## How to Deploy ETL Pipeline: 
The pipeline is triggered biannually on the 15th day of April and October to update data, but can be deployed at any time. To use the pipeline, you will need access to your own SQL/MySQLWorkbench account and python-supported environments (Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, etc.) that are SQL-integrated. The first step is to clone the repository. The second step is to update your personal SQL password string in the placeholder-password object at the top of the code file.
